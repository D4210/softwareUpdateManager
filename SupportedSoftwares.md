For example:&quot;Install Location&quot;  &nbsp;  &quot;Display Name,Display Version&quot;  <br/>You can use the column numbers instead of column names, for example: &quot;Column1,Column3&quot;<br/>If [Display Columns] is an empty string, GetNir will display the entire csv/tab-delimited line.<p/>The [Filter Expression] is an expression similar to the SQL WHERE clause that filters the records you want to see. <p/>In the {More Options} section you can use the following options:<p/><table class="mytable1"><tr><td class="tdnowrap">/NoColumnNames  <td>If the first line of the tab-delimited/comma-delimited data doesn't contain the column/field names (In NirSoft tools - 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option is turned off)you should specify the /NoColumnNames command-line option.<br/>In the [Display Columns] and [Filter Expression] you should use Column1 as name of the first column, Column2 as name of the second column, and so on...<tr><td class="tdnowrap">/TopLines {Number Of Lines}  <td>Display only the top xx lines.</table><p/><h4 class="utilsubject">The Filter Expression</h4><ul class="spacelist"><li>The filter expression is similar to the SQL WHERE clause and allows you to filter the records you want to see.<li>You must put the entire filter expression in double quotes (&quot;&quot;) and also every field name or string in the expression that contains one or morespace characters must be in single quotes ('').<li>When a column name has space characters, you can omit the spaces and then there is no need to put the name in single quotes.For example: Instead of 'Display Name', you can specify the column name as DisplayName.<li>The following operators are supported: = &nbsp; != &nbsp; &gt; &nbsp; &lt; &nbsp; &gt;=  &nbsp; &lt;=  &nbsp;  Like Contains BeginsWith EndsWith Not And Or .You can use &amp;&amp; instead of 'And' ,  || instead of  'Or', like in C/C++/C#/Java.<li>The gt; &nbsp; &lt; &nbsp; &gt;=  &nbsp; &lt;=  operators can be used for numeric columns to get the desired range, for example: &quot;Channel >= 1 && Channel <= 3&quot;<li>The Like operator checks a string using a wildcard, for example: &quot;DisplayName LIKE 'Mozilla Firefox*'&quot;   &nbsp;  &quot;SSID LIKE 'MyNet?'&quot;<li>The BeginsWith operator checks if a string begins with the specified string, for example: &quot;DisplayName BeginsWith 'Mozilla Firefox'&quot;<li>The EndsWith operator checks if a string ends with the specified string, for example: &quot;'Host Name' EndsWith .com&quot;<li>The Contains operator checks if a string contains the  specified string, for example: &quot;'Host Name' Contains Google&quot;<li>You can use the NOT operator to reverse the result, for example... If you want to get all records that their 'Host Name' doesn't contain the 'Google' string:&quot;'Host Name' Not Contains Google&quot;<li>You can use column numbers instead of column names. Column1 for the first column, Column2 for the second column, and so on.For example: &quot;Column1=5 && Column3=10&quot;</ul><p/><h4 class="utilsubject">Using GetNir With NirSoft Tools</h4>In most NirSoft tools you can send tab-delimited or comma-delimited data to stdout by specifying empty string (&quot;&quot;) instead of filename, for example:<br/>UninstallView.exe /stab &quot;&quot; <p/>This feature allows you work directly with GetNir without writing the data to a file.<p/>In order to type the correct column name to display and filter, you have to look at the names of the columns as they appear in the GUI and inside exported files:<br/><img src="getnir_uninstallview.png" /><p/>So now let's say that you want to get the uninstall string of Google Chrome from the UninstallView tool:<br/>UninstallView.exe /stab &quot;&quot; | GetNir &quot;Uninstall String&quot; &quot;'Registry Name'='Google Chrome'&quot;<p/>In the above command, UninstallView sends to stdout the list of all installed programs, as tab-delimited format.GetNir receives the data from UninstallView and searches the record with 'Google Chrome' value under the 'Registry Name' column.When GetNir finds the record, it display the value of 'Uninstall String' column:<br/><img src="getnir_uninstallview2.png"><p/>You can also use the column names without space characters, for example:<br/>UninstallView.exe /stab &quot;&quot; | GetNir &quot;UninstallString&quot; &quot;RegistryName='Google Chrome'&quot;<p/>If you already have the csv/tab-delimited data on a file, you can also use GetNir to extract the desired value from the file, for example:<br/>GetNir &quot;UninstallString&quot; &quot;RegistryName='Google Chrome'&quot; &lt; uninstallview.csv<p/><h4 class="utilsubject">License</h4>This utility is released as freeware.
